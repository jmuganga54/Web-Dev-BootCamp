It's important to consider their moods when selecting fonts for your design.

There are two main type of font family mostly used `Serif` and `San-serif`. `Serif` fonts, make your design look more serious, authoritative and old. Serif fonts can be used for letter head.

`San-serif` fonts are more friendly, approachable, novel and contemporary. Most startup companies prefer using San-serif fonts. These fonts are more readable compared to `Serif` fonts.

It is more recommended to use only 2 fonts for your single design, instead of using 10 fonts for a single design.

`Combing different fonts` you can be creative when using two fonts on your design, using them differently.

### User Interface Design
On this section we will learn about `User Interface Design`, this is all about designing the appearance of the website that we are building.

We will pass through some of the Design principles that are important to consider when building your website.

#### 1.HIERARCHY
![Hierarchy](./imgs/hierarchy.png)
> Take a look on this image.
![Your Eyes Here](./imgs/your_eyes_here.png)

When you look at this image, you will find that, you will start to look at `YOUR EYES HERE`, followed by `then here`, then `isn't that fascinating` text. This is how our brain works, we tend to go for the bigger,bold things followed with the smallest thing.

> Take a look on this image
![Dear Jane](./imgs/dearJane.png)

When you look at this image, the left image all the text have been wrote using the same weight, this make it hard to grasp the important information. Looking on the right image, the important information have been written using large font, this makes it easy capture the important information, instead of spending a lot of time reading all the card.

This is what we call `hierarchy`. We can different way to establish hierarchy.

> COLOUR
![Color](./imgs/colour.png)

Color can be used to establish hierarchy, different things can be given different colors depending on what you want to present.

> SIZE
![size](./imgs/size.png)

Size can also be used to establish hierarchy, the bigger the size, the more attention it get, the smaller the size, the less attention it gets.

#### 2. LAYOUT
![layout](./imgs/layout.png)
`Layout` is how you organize your items on a page/website. Organization of items on a website real matters when working on a design of any design.

One of the things to consider when working on the layout, is the `line of texts`. When the line of text is too long, it makes it hard for a reader to follow and read. Also when it's too short, it looks weird and un professional. It is recommended to make it medium, find a balance, not too long, not too short.

#### 3. ALIGNMENT
![Alignment](./imgs/alignment.png)

This is all about how you position each element on your website relative to each other.

One of the way to achieve this is reducing the number of indent line, relative to each item on the website. Take a look on the below image.
![indent_line](./imgs/indent_line.png)

We can use grid lines to do so.
![Many indent line](./imgs/many_indent_line.png)

> Based on the below image, left is bad design, right is a good design

#### 4. WHITE SPACE
![White Space](./imgs/white_space.png)

Refers to empty space around text or around elements.

More empty space around text or around elements on the website is much more better, compared to less space. When designing it is important to around much space around element. The more space around the element in a design, the more the design will look professional and expensive.
