## Keypoints and Notes

### Color Theory

Is the art and science of creating a right palette of your website.

When you pick your color pallette you have to be aware of the `moods` of your color palette.

#### Combining Colors

Most of the time you will not use only one color to your website. Most of the time you can use more than one color to design your website.

When combining colors it's important to think about different colors to combine.

Designers your different scientific ways to combine colors.

`Analogous Colors` taking two colors which are next to each other on color wheeel.

`Complementary colors` taking colors that are opposite to each other, this make the design to `Pop`
![Complementary Colors](./imgs/complementary.png)

`Triadic Color` you can draw a triangle on color wheel and pick different color pointed on the triange.

### Understand Typography and How to Choose a Font

`Typography` or fonts really matters for your design or when designing website.
![fonts matters](./imgs/fonts_matters.png)

It's important to consider their moods when selecting fonts for your design.

There are two main type of font family mostly used `Serif` and `San-serif`. `Serif` fonts, make your design look more serious, authoritative and old. Serif fonts can be used for letter head.
![Serif](./imgs/serif.png)

`San-serif` fonts are more friendly, approachable, novel and contemporary. Most startup companies prefer using San-serif fonts. These fonts are more readable compared to `Serif` fonts.
![San-serif](./imgs/san_serifs.png)

It is more recommended to use only 2 fonts for your single design, instead of using 10 fonts for a single design.
![Less fonts](./imgs/less_fonts.png)

`Combing different fonts` you can be creative when using two fonts on your design, using them differently.
![combining fonts](./imgs/combining_fonts.png)

`Wip these fonts in you mind` it is very hard to create a good design your these fonts, that way it is recommended to wip them out in your mind.
![Wip these fonts](./imgs/wip_fonts.png)

`To summarize` What type face you choose must base on what you want to convey to your audience with those fonts. Fonts have moods,so choose serif and san-serif family, accordingly based on what you want to present.

### User Interface Design

On this section we will learn about `User Interface Design`, this is all about designing the appearance of the website that we are building.

We will pass through some of the Design principles that are important to consider when building your website.

#### 1.HIERARCHY

![Hierarchy](./imgs/hierarchy.png)

> Take a look on this image.
> ![Your Eyes Here](./imgs/your_eyes_here.png)

When you look at this image, you will find that, you will start to look at `YOUR EYES HERE`, followed by `then here`, then `isn't that fascinating` text. This is how our brain works, we tend to go for the bigger,bold things followed with the smallest thing.

> Take a look on this image
> ![Dear Jane](./imgs/dearJane.png)

When you look at this image, the left image all the text have been wrote using the same weight, this make it hard to grasp the important information. Looking on the right image, the important information have been written using large font, this makes it easy capture the important information, instead of spending a lot of time reading all the card.

This is what we call `hierarchy`. We can different way to establish hierarchy.

> COLOUR
> ![Color](./imgs/colour.png)

Color can be used to establish hierarchy, different things can be given different colors depending on what you want to present.

> SIZE
> ![size](./imgs/size.png)

Size can also be used to establish hierarchy, the bigger the size, the more attention it get, the smaller the size, the less attention it gets.

#### 2. LAYOUT

![layout](./imgs/layout.png)
`Layout` is how you organize your items on a page/website. Organization of items on a website real matters when working on a design of any design.

One of the things to consider when working on the layout, is the `line of texts`. When the line of text is too long, it makes it hard for a reader to follow and read. Also when it's too short, it looks weird and un professional. It is recommended to make it medium, find a balance, not too long, not too short.
![Line text](./imgs/line_text.png)

#### 3. ALIGNMENT

![Alignment](./imgs/alignment.png)

This is all about how you position each element on your website relative to each other.

One of the way to achieve this is reducing the number of indent line, relative to each item on the website. Take a look on the below image.
![indent_line](./imgs/indent_line.png)

We can use grid lines to do so.
![Many indent line](./imgs/many_indent_line.png)

> Based on the below image, left is bad design, right is a good design
> ![Layout example](./imgs/layout_example.png)

#### 4. WHITE SPACE

![White Space](./imgs/white_space.png)

Refers to empty space around text or around elements.

More empty space around text or around elements on the website is much more better, compared to less space. When designing it is important to around much space around element. The more space around the element in a design, the more the design will look professional and expensive.

> Take a look on this design, note the difference
> ![White space around](./imgs/white_space_around.png)

#### 5. AUDIENCE

![Audience](./imgs/audience.png)

Any design work must consider the audience of who the design is presented to. Difference audience understand or have difference observation.

> Take a look on this image, then note the difference
> ![Children](./imgs/children.png)

The audience for this design is children, which design you think will be better for such audience?. Obliviously the right side design, will fit better the targeted audience.

### User Experience UX Design

### What is UX Design?

- When we work on the `User Interface Design` of the website, we sent a great time on the aesthetic of the website ( how the website looks) and enforce that to the user.
- User Experience (UX Design), is meant to be invisible, making a website easy to use.

So when working on the User Experience, you have to look on the following things. The following are the things that you have to look on when working on the `User Experience Design (UX)`.

### 1. Simplicity

![Simplicity](./imgs/simplicity.png)
All the time when dealing with the User Experience, make sure you make your website site. Always keep things simple.

> Consider these images, the first website is complex, which the following image is good design which is simple
> ![Complex](./imgs/complex.png) > ![Simple](./imgs/simple.png)

### 2. Consistency

![Consistency](./imgs/consistency.png)
This is all about keeping your design consistency + the functionality of the website consistency. For example when user is moving from one page to another page, the overall design of the website must look consistency, this make it easy for the user to navigate your website.

Inconsistency may make a user confused when using a website, when going from one part of the website to another

> Consider this images, which includes different part ot the website lacking consistency
> ![Consistency](./imgs/inconsistent.png)

### 3. Reading Patterns

![reading patterns](./imgs/reading-patterns.png)
This is all about reading patterns, how humans track web pages, parts they look when browsing on websites.

The following are some of the common reading patterns that humans us

#### F Layout PATTERN

This is one of the common reading pattern that humans use when browsing on the website, see the diagram below.
![F pattern](./imgs/f_pattern.png)

> Example of F layout pattern
> ![Example of F layout pattern](./imgs/example_flayout.png)

#### Z Layout PATTERN

Another reading pattern is called Z-layout pattern. User start reading the website from left to right, zigzag then all the way to the bottom of the website.
![Z layout pattern](./imgs/z_layout_pattern.png)

Most common used for video content website or enabling a user to read the website a lot faster.

> Example of Z layout pattern is facebook login page, see the image below.
> ![Example Z layout pattern](./imgs/example_z_layout.png)

> Note each Layout pattern depends on the type of the website.

### 4. All Platform Design

This is all about designing a website that scale well on mobile and vice versa, this is what is called `RESPONSIVE DESIGN`, designing a website that will scale well to each view port.

Looking good on mobile but also on wide screen such as desktop, tablets, tv, etc.

> The example below shows good and bad design, not following responsive design
> ![Responsive Design](./imgs/responsive_design.png)

When working on responsive design, please avoid putting a lot of empty spaces around your design. See the image below.
![Empty Spaces](./imgs/empty_space.png)

Also avoid having so much banner on your website, this makes your content on your website very small. Scaling too much on images is also a problem, so avoid too much scaling.

> The left images shows too much banner anr the right image too much scaling on the image.
> ![Too much banner and too much scaling](./imgs/scaling.png)

> Test
> To achieve all the above, you need to put your website on testing, you can do this buy asking your colleagues or friend assisting you on testing.

### 5. Don't Use your powers to Evil

![Dont do evil](./imgs/dont_do_evil.png)
Some designers use the knowledge they know about Psychology, UX Design and User Interface Design to do bad things.

Dark UX pattern is when designers create an experience that pushes users in a direction that benefits the interests of the company rather than the user.
